    "Welcome to this week's programming assignment on exploring word vectors.\n",
    "In natural language processing, we represent each word as a vector consisting of numbers.\n",
    "The vector encodes the meaning of the word. These numbers (or weights) for each word are learned using various machine\n",
    "learning models, which we will explore in more detail later in this specialization. Rather than make you code the\n",
    "machine learning models from scratch, we will show you how to use them. In the real world, you can always load the\n",
    "trained word vectors, and you will almost never have to train them from scratch. In this assignment, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict analogies between words.\n",
    "- Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the word embeddings and plot them in two dimensions.\n",
    "- Compare word embeddings by using a similarity measure (the cosine similarity).\n",
    "- Understand how these vector space models work.\n",

    "## 1.0 Predict the Countries from Capitals\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lectures, we have illustrated the word analogies\n",
    "by finding the capital of a country from the country. \n",
    "We have changed the problem a bit in this part of the assignment. You are asked to predict the **countries** \n",
    "that corresponds to some **capitals**.\n",
    "You are playing trivia against some second grader who just took their geography test and knows all the capitals by heart.\n",
    "Thanks to NLP, you will be able to answer the questions properly. In other words, you will write a program that can give\n",
    "you the country by its capital. That way you are pretty sure you will win the trivia game. We will start by exploring the data set.\n",

    "# 3.0 Plotting the vectors using PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will explore the distance between word vectors after reducing their dimension.\n",
    "The technique we will employ is known as\n",
    "[*principal component analysis* (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).\n",
    "As we saw, we are working in a 300-dimensional space in this case.\n",
    "Although from a computational perspective we were able to perform a good job,\n",
    "it is impossible to visualize results in such high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of PCA as a method that projects our vectors in a space of reduced\n",
    "dimension, while keeping the maximum information about the original vectors in\n",
    "their reduced counterparts. In this case, by *maximum infomation* we mean that the\n",
    "Euclidean distance between the original vectors and their projected siblings is\n",
    "minimal. Hence vectors that were originally close in the embeddings dictionary,\n",
    "will produce lower dimensional vectors that are still close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that when you map out the words, similar words will be clustered\n",
    "next to each other. For example, the words 'sad', 'happy', 'joyful' all describe\n",
    "emotion and are supposed to be near each other when plotted.\n",
    "The words: 'oil', 'gas', and 'petroleum' all describe natural resources.\n",
    "Words like 'city', 'village', 'town' could be seen as synonyms and describe a\n",
    "similar thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before plotting the words, you need to first be able to reduce each word vector\n",
    "with PCA into 2 dimensions and then plot it. The steps to compute PCA are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean normalize the data\n",
    "2. Compute the covariance matrix of your data ($\\Sigma$). \n",
    "3. Compute the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of your covariance matrix\n",
    "4. Multiply the first K eigenvectors by your normalized data. The transformation should look something as follows:\n",

    "* The word vectors are of dimension 300. \n",
    "* Use PCA to change the 300 dimensions to `n_components` dimensions. \n",
    "* The new matrix should be of dimension `m, n_componentns`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* First de-mean the data\n",
    "* Get the eigenvalues using `linalg.eigh`.  Use `eigh` rather than `eig` since R is symmetric.  The performance gain when using `eigh` instead of `eig` is substantial.\n",
